# Firebase to Supabase Migration Notes

## Changes Made

1. Replaced Firebase imports with Supabase imports in:
   - `/src/app/report/[id]/page.tsx`
   - `/src/app/admin/actions.ts`

2. Updated data fetching logic:
   - Changed Firebase document references to Supabase table queries
   - Updated field names to match Supabase schema (e.g., `colorAnalysis` â†’ `color_analysis`)

3. Fixed build issues:
   - Wrapped `useSearchParams` in a Suspense boundary in the login page
   - Created a separate `LoginContent` component to handle the search params

4. Added deployment safeguards:
   - Updated `deploy-with-env.sh` to check for Firebase references before deployment
   - Ensured all required environment variables are set for Supabase

## Remaining Tasks

1. Verify that all data is correctly migrated from Firebase to Supabase
2. Test all functionality that previously used Firebase
3. Update any documentation that references Firebase

## Deployment Instructions

1. Use the updated `deploy-with-env.sh` script to deploy to Vercel
2. Ensure the Supabase service role key is set in your environment variables
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any remaining Firebase references

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment:

1. Run `npm run build` locally to check for compilation errors
2. Use `grep -r "firebase" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" ./src` to find any remaining Firebase references
3. Check the Vercel deployment logs for specific errors
